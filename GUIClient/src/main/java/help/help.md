This program was developed for my Diploma in Software Development at the 
South Metropolitan TAFE, Rockingham WA.

This application allows the user to perform the following functions:

- Create a new account
- Login to an existing account
- Chat to the echo server (Socket Server)

## New Account

To create a new account, select the menu options: User/New Account. 
This will display the New Account form.
Enter a valid Username and Password, typing in the same Password in both 
password fields, then press [Submit].
If the new account is created, then you will be automatically logged in.
If there is an error, make the appropriate changes and try again.

## Login

To login under an existing user account, select menu options: User/Login. 
This will display the Login form.
Enter your Username and Password, then press [Submit].
If your details are accepted, you will be logged in.
If unsuccessful, then make the needed changes and try again.

## Chat

Once you are logged in, you will be able open a Chat session by selecting
the menu options: Chat/Open.

This will display the Chat form. To use this, just enter text into the
box at the bottom of the form, and either press the Enter key or the button:
[Send]. Your message will be displayed in the "Outgoing messages" window
and the response from the Chat server will appear in the "Incoming messages"
window.

To finish the Chat session, select the menu options: Chat/Close.
You can then either Logout (User/Logout) or shut down the program (File/Exit).
